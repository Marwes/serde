**serde_seed is an experimental addition to serde which makes it possible to pass state to the [de]serialized data structures.**

## Serde in action

See https://docs.rs/serde_seed for examples

## Getting help

Serde developers live in the #serde channel on
[`irc.mozilla.org`](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC). The #rust channel is also a
good resource with generally faster response time but less specific knowledge
about Serde. If IRC is not your thing or you don't get a good response, we are
happy to respond to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/new)
as well.
